| 10/25 |  11:30 - 11:55am  |                                                                                                            I thought through the problem in-class with what kind of objects to use and opened the file. |
| 10/25 | 11:50pm - 12:10am |                                                                                                                  I started writing pseudocode to think through my ideas on how to approach the problem. |
| 10/28 |   8:55 - 9:30pm   |                                                                                   I thought through the problem and wrote the basics of what I thought about down. I continued to write out pseudocode. |
| 10/28 |  9:45 - 10:10pm   |                                               I made a basic version of a hash method which helped me create the query method. Then, I thought through the buildTable() method and wrote some comments. |
| 10/30 |  10:30 - 11:00pm  |                                                                                  I worked on implementing the pseudocode I had written by taking it and writing the code corresponding to the comments. |
| 10/30 |  11:25 - 11:50pm  |                                                      I continued implementing the code from the comments I had written and writing <br/>more in-depth comments for the areas in which I was struggling. |
| 11/3  |  10:50 - 11:15pm  | I started working on the hash map with linear probing solution by using the pseudocode on the slides. I'm struggling with figuring out how to convert the keyCol versus valCol and how to convert back. |
| 11/4  |  12:50 - 1:15pm   |                     I worked on my solution by making the HashMap class and the methods within it. I'm struggling to implement buildTable() and trying to figure out how to read the lines of the file. |
| 11/4  |   1:15 - 1:40pm   |                                                          I worked through my problem and have all the right methods, but seem to have a problem with query() that is leading to an out of bounds error. |
| 11/5  |  10:30 - 10:45pm  |                                                                                                   I worked on debugging the HashMap get(), add(), and resize() methods to avoid an out of bounds error. |
| 11/7  |  10:05 - 10:20am  |                                                             I worked to make the code more efficient, with Mr. Blick's help. The code now runs without error, but I'm working on making the keys match. |
| 11/7  |  10:20 - 10:40am  |                      Some of the test cases are working, while some are timing out and others are receiving an out of bounds error. I think some of the code is too slow and am approaching that issue. |
| 11/7  |   8:30 - 8:45pm   |                                                                                                                                I tried to figure out where the tests may be timing out without success. |
| 11/7  |   9:20 - 9:40pm   |                                                       I worked on debugging the code within my methods to speed it up and looked at an individual problem with a key mismatch in the testStocks() test. |
| 11/7  |  10:10 - 10:40pm  |                                                                                                                                   I worked through solving the testStocks() problem and wrote comments. |
| 11/8  |   8:20 - 8:45am   |                                                                                                                                  I rethought the get() method and am now working on the mismatch error. |
| 11/8  |   9:05 - 9:10am   |                                                                                                                  I messed with the default table size and radix to find a pair that made the code work! |
