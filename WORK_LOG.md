| 10/25 | 11:50pm - 12:10am |                                                                                                                  I started writing pseudocode to think through my ideas on how to approach the problem. |

| 10/28 |  9:45 - 10:10pm   |                                               I made a basic version of a hash method which helped me create the query method. Then, I thought through the buildTable() method and wrote some comments. |
| 10/30 |  10:30 - 11:00pm  |                                                                                  I worked on implementing the pseudocode I had written by taking it and writing the code corresponding to the comments. |

| 11/3  |  10:50 - 11:15pm  | I started working on the hash map with linear probing solution by using the pseudocode on the slides. I'm struggling with figuring out how to convert the keyCol versus valCol and how to convert back. |
